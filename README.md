# Test-Bot
An experimental conversational bot using the MS Bot Framework. This is my first experiment with this framework and was done for a hack in a few hours.
Do not look for code quality!! :-)
It demonstrates the usage of prompts and intent dialogs (relying on simple regex) following the waterfall flow of dialogs.
